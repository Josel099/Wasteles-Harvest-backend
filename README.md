# Wasteles-Harvest-backend
This project aims to create a food waste management system that connects food suppliers with nearby individuals or organizations in need of food. The system allows food suppliers to create listings of their excess food, which recipients can search and contact the supplier to arrange for pickup. The project utilizes React for the frontend, which is a JavaScript framework. The backend is implemented using Java programming language and the Spring Boot framework, while the database is managed using MySQL. By combining these technologies, the system aims to reduce food waste, increase access to nutritious food, and promote social responsibility and community engagement, all while improving environmental sustainability.
