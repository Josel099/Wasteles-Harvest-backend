## Overview 🌎

WastelessHarvest is a revolutionary platform dedicated to reducing food waste by connecting food suppliers (e.g., restaurants, supermarkets, caterers) with individuals or organizations in need of food assistance. The food waste management system connects food suppliers with nearby individuals or organizations in need of food. Food suppliers create listings for their excess food on the platform, describing the type and quantity of food available, as well as the pickup location and time. Recipients search for available listings on the platform and contact the food supplier directly to arrange for pickup. The system provides contact details for the supplier. 🤝

This project is built using the following technologies:
- **Frontend**: React ⚛️
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 🍃
- **Database**: MySQL 🦈

This repository contains the frontend of our application, which is built using React. To fully utilize the application, you need to set up the backend of the project. You can find instructions for setting up the backend by visiting the [backend repository](https://github.com/Josel099/Wasteles-Harvest-backend). 🚀
